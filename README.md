# BPL Interpreter
Open-source, cross-platform interpreter for BPL

<h3>16.01 Preview</h3>

What's new:
- Improved algorithm of interpreting;
- Fixed a lot of bugs;
- Temporarily removed errors;
- Added blocks of code (like functions in other languages, but without return value and argument, just block of code);
- Added __DOBLOCK__ operator, witch runs some block of code;
- Added __IMPORT__ operator, witch imports blocks of code from another file;
- Added __BLOCKLIST__ operator, witch displays list of blocks in format "â„–: name [number of lines]";
- Added recursion.

P.S. Project was rewritten from QtCreator to Code::Blocks :tada:
